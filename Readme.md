### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install fastapi sqlalchemy uvicorn psycopg2-binary
```

### Populating the Database

To populate the database with sample data, run the following in a Python shell:

```python
from database import SessionLocal
from main import populate_sample_data

db = SessionLocal()
populate_sample_data(db)
```

### Running the Server

Run the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Example API Calls

- **Get all crimes:**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/crimes
  ```

  curl http://localhost:8000/crimes/1
  ```

## Database Schema

The application uses the following database models:

- **Crimes**: Stores basic information about each crime.
- **Elements**: Lists the elements required to constitute each crime.
- **Arrest_Rules**: Defines arrest conditions and authorities for each crime.
- **Case_Laws**: Stores case law references related to each crime.
